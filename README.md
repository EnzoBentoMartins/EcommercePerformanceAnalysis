# E-commerce Performance Analysis Project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze the sales data of an e-commerce company, focusing on understanding sales patterns based on categories, products, brands, and responsible supervisors. The goal is to generate a predictive study for future sales, providing insights into trends and helping to optimize business strategies.

## Project Description
In this project, we explore the sales data of an e-commerce platform to identify important trends and patterns that can be used to forecast future sales. The analysis covers various aspects of the data, including product categories, brand performance, supervisor responsibility, and overall sales dynamics.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following variables:

- **Order_Number**: Unique identifier for each order.
- **State_Code**: The state where the customer is located.
- **Customer_Name**: The name of the customer making the purchase.
- **Order_Date**: The date the order was placed.
- **Status**: The status of the order (e.g., completed, canceled, pending).
- **Product**: The name of the product purchased.
- **Category**: The category to which the product belongs.
- **Brand**: The brand of the product.
- **Cost**: The cost price of the product.
- **Sales**: The selling price of the product.
- **Quantity**: The quantity of the product purchased.
- **Total_Cost**: The total cost of the products in the order.
- **Total_Sales**: The total sales value of the products in the order.
- **Assigned Supervisor**: The supervisor responsible for overseeing the sales transaction.

## Analysis
The analysis includes:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigating the dataset to uncover insights, detect patterns, and identify potential anomalies.
2. **Sales Patterns**: Identifying trends in product sales, category performance, and brand comparisons.
3. **Supervisor Impact**: Understanding the role of supervisors and how their oversight may influence sales.
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Developing a predictive model to estimate future sales based on historical data and identified trends.

## Tools & Technologies
The following tools and technologies were used in this project:

- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries for plotting graphs.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for building predictive models.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for analyzing and documenting the project.

## Results & Insights
This project provides actionable insights, including:

- Best-performing product categories and brands.
- Sales trends over time.
- Potential future sales predictions.

## Future Work

- Improved predictive models: Experiment with other machine learning techniques to improve prediction accuracy.
- Incorporating external data: Integrate external factors such as marketing campaigns, seasonality, and external economic factors into the analysis.
- Real-time analysis: Implement real-time sales tracking and predictions.
